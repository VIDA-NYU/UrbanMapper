# ðŸŽ¨ Urban Mapper's UX Design

While Urban Mapper is a free and open-source project, it is important to maintain a consistent flow of how
does the library works, both on a standard data-flowchart and a snippet-code based flowchart.

As a result, all of our designs were done through FiJam and are available below for an interactive viz.

Feel free to open an issue for any feedback or suggestions on the designs.
