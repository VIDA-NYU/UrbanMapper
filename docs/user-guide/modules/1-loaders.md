# 🌇 Loaders: Bringing Your Data to Life

Loaders are your gateway into `UrbanMapper`—they take your raw data, whether it’s stashed in a `CSV`, a `Shapefile`, or
already `loaded in memory as a DataFrame`, and turn it into a `GeoDataFrame` that `UrbanMapper` can work with seamlessly.
Think of loaders as the bridge between your data and the spatial insights you’re after, making sure everything is ready
for `mapping`, `enrichment`, and `analysis`.

!!! question "Why Loaders Matter?"
    Loaders aren’t just about importing data—they standardise it into a format (`GeoDataFrame`) that powers `UrbanMapper`’s workflows. Without them, your data would be like a puzzle with missing pieces, unable to connect to the urban layers you want to explore.

## 📂 Types of Loaders

`UrbanMapper` provides loaders for a variety of data formats, so you can bring in your data however it’s stored:

- **CSV Loader**: Great for tabular data like spreadsheets. Tell it where your coordinates are, and it’ll handle the
  rest.
- **Shapefile Loader**: A go-to for GIS pros—loads ESRI Shapefiles with all their spatial details intact. We automatically infer the coordinates based on the geometry of each records in the dataset.
- **Parquet Loader**: Perfect for large datasets—reads efficient Parquet files while preserving geospatial info.

And if your data’s already loaded by any means in your Python script or Notebook's cell:

- **From (Geo)Pandas DataFrame**: Have a DataFrame ready? Load it up with `with_dataframe` instead of `from_file` and you're good to go.

!!! question "Which Loader Should I Use?"
    It does not really matter which loader you choose, as `UrbanMapper` will automatically infer the correct one based on the file extension. However, here are some guidelines:
        
    - **CSV**: For simple, tabular data (e.g., taxi trip logs).
    - **Shapefile**: For GIS-ready files with built-in geometry.
    - **Parquet**: For large, optimised datasets.
    - **DataFrames**: When your data’s already in memory from another process.

## 🏗️ Instantiating your first `Loader`

Setting up a loader is as easy as pie—`UrbanMapper`’s factory pattern lets you customise it step-by-step. Here’s how to get started.

### Basic Example: Loading from a CSV
Imagine you’ve got taxi trip data in a CSV file:

```python
import urban_mapper as um

loader = (
    um.loader
    .from_file("./data/taxi_trips.csv")
    .with_columns(longitude_column="pickup_longitude", latitude_column="pickup_latitude")
    .build()
)
```

- **What’s going on?**
  - `from_file("./data/taxi_trips.csv")`: Points to your CSV file.
  - `with_columns(...)`: Tells `UrbanMapper` which columns hold your coordinates.
  - `build()`: Locks it in, creating your loader.

### More Ways to Load Data
UrbanMapper’s got options for a lot of scenario:

- **From a Shapefile**: For spatial data straight from GIS tools.
  ```python
  loader = (
      um.loader
      .from_file("./data/neighborhoods.shp")
      .build()
  )
  ```
- **From a Parquet File**: Fast and efficient for big data.
  ```python
  loader = (
      um.loader
      .from_file("./data/taxi_trips.parquet")
      .with_columns(longitude_column="pickup_longitude", latitude_column="pickup_latitude")
      .build()
  )
  ```
- **From a Pandas DataFrame**: When your data’s already in memory.
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  df = pd.read_csv("./data/taxi_trips.csv")
  loader = (
      um.loader
      .from_dataframe(df)
      .with_columns(longitude_column="pickup_longitude", latitude_column="pickup_latitude")
      .build()
  )
  ```
- **From a GeoPandas GeoDataFrame**: For prepped geospatial data.
  ```python
  import geopandas as gpd
  gdf = gpd.read_file("./data/neighborhoods.shp")
  loader = (
      um.loader
      .from_dataframe(gdf)
      .build()
  )
  ```

## 🌍 Setting the Coordinate Reference System (CRS)

`UrbanMapper` defaults to `WGS84 (EPSG:4326)`—the universal language of latitude and longitude. But if your data uses a different CRS, you can set it:

```python
loader = (
    um.loader
    .from_file("./data/taxi_trips.csv")
    .with_columns(longitude_column="pickup_longitude", latitude_column="pickup_latitude")
    .with_crs("EPSG:3857")  # Web Mercator, for example
    .build()
)
```

- **Why bother?** A mismatched CRS is like using a map from the wrong city—setting it right keeps your data aligned with the urban layers and the continuing `UrbanMapper`'s owrkflow.

## 📦 Loading the Data

Once your loader’s built, fetching the data is a snap:

```python
gdf = loader.load()
print(f"Number of rows: {len(gdf)}")
print(f"Columns: {gdf.columns.tolist()}")
print(f"CRS: {gdf.crs}")
```

- **Pro tip**: Try `gdf.head()` to sneak a peek or `gdf.explore()` for an interactive map right in your notebook.

## 🔄 Loaders in a Pipeline

`Loaders` shine as the first step in an `UrbanMapper` pipeline, feeding data into the next stages:

```python
from urban_mapper.pipeline import UrbanPipeline

pipeline = UrbanPipeline([
    ("loader", loader),
    ("urban_layer", urban_layer),
    # Add more components like imputers or enrichers
])

mapped_data, enriched_layer = pipeline.transform()
```

- **Why pipelines?** They’re like a conveyor belt—`loaders` start the process, passing your data smoothly to mapping and enrichment.
