# Pipeline Generators

!!! tip "What is the Pipeline Generator module?"
    The `Pipeline Generator` module is solving the following scenario, imagine telling `UrbanMapper` exactly what 
    urban analysis you want, and watching it craft a pipeline for youâ€”no coding required. Powered by 
    `Large Language Models (LLMs)`, this module transforms your natural language descriptions into executable 
    Python code for `UrbanMapper` pipelines.

    We highly recommend to look through the `User Guide`'s Pipeline generator section for a more in-depth introduction about
    the pipeline generator module and its usage prior to explore its API.

!!! warning "Documentation Under Alpha Construction"
    **This documentation is in its early stages and still being developed.** The API may therefore change, 
    and some parts might be incomplete or inaccurate.  

    **Use at your own risk**, and please report anything that seems `incorrect` / `outdated` you find.
