# Interactive Table VIS Mixin

!!! tip "What is Interactive Table VIS Mixin?"
    The `Interactive Table VIS` mixin is responsible to allow the user to vis. and interact with any dataset of interest
    within your Jupyter Notebook much better than Pandas Dataframe visualisation. Showing off statistics on top
    of each of your dataset's attributes, etc.

    A mixin, in this very instance, is nothing more than a class that connects external libraries for their use
    directly adapted towards the `UrbanMapper` workflow.
