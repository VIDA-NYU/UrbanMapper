    "First and foremost, please bear with us; some of our Jupyter Notebooks cannot be interactive and are thus displayed as is in the documentation.  Feel free to install the library and test it out locally.  Next, determine whether they are interactive, which means you can see the output of each cell.  As a result, because it is not a good practice to save datasets in a GitHub (or any other Git in general) repository, we attempted to import urban datasets from `HuggingFace` using `from_huggingface(.)` rather than `from_file(.)`, which would need local file availability.  Nonetheless, this was (1) not always viable (certain datasets are not on `HuggingFace`), and (2) this does not preclude you from using `from_file(.)` or any other available via the API reference's `Loader` module."
