# Per-Module Examples Directory

This directory contains examples demonstrating the usage of different UrbanMapper modules. The following files have been modified to showcase raster data functionality:

## Modified Files

### 1. loader(modified_for_rasters_project).ipynb
This notebook demonstrates the evolution and usage of different raster loader versions:
- Shows comparison between CSV and raster data loading
- Presents raster loader V3 with visualization using matplotlib
- Demonstrates raster loaders V4 and V5 with their outputs
- Explores raster loader V6 with different block sizes (10, 1000)
- Includes performance analysis of loading times vs block sizes

### 2. visualiser(modified_for_rasters_project).ipynb
This notebook focuses on visualization capabilities for raster data:
- Shows both static and interactive visualization methods
- Demonstrates visualizations with different block sizes (10, 100, 1000)
- Includes performance metrics for different visualization approaches
- Uses various datasets to showcase visualization flexibility

## Important Notes

- **Limited Modifications**: Only the above two files were modified. All other files in this directory remain unchanged from the main branch.

- **Example Choices**: The examples shown in these notebooks represent just a subset of possible configurations:
  - Block sizes (10, 100, 1000) are examples; you can experiment with other values
  - Datasets used are for demonstration; feel free to use other raster data
  - Loader versions shown are selected examples; you can explore other versions

- **Data Sources**: All raster data used in these examples are documented and available in my personal GitHub repository:
  - Full dataset descriptions
  - Data sources and attributions
  - Download instructions
  - Visit: [Personal GitHub Repository](https://github.com/JUDITH-sketch/Rasters_Studies_for_UrbanMapper-OSCUR/blob/main/README.md)

## Running the Examples

Feel free to experiment with:
- Different block sizes for performance tuning
- Various raster datasets
- Different loader versions
- Alternative visualization settings

The examples shown are just starting points to demonstrate the capabilities - customize them to your needs!
